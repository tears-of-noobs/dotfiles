Script *installer.sh* bootstraping your environment with selected theme (solarized-light, solarized-dark, seoul256-dark).

Everything what to do - is running it with argument
```
installer.sh seoul256-dark
```

Script bootstrap:
* Dependency packages (rxvt-unicode, vim, mcabber, zsh, i3wm)
* VIM confuguration with Vundle
* rxvt configuration with selected theme
* Fonts
* Dircolors
* My own ZSH theme `norm+` and optionally my aliases.
* Mcabber configuration with seoul256-dark theme
